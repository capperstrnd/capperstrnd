# Hello there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a calm, curious and somewhat eccentric personality with a passion for programming and a keen sense and eye for UX and design.

In my free time you can find me working on my [vanlife build](https://instagram.com/wheeldweel) (soon to be my permanent residence âœ¨) or various programming projects, researching new frameworks and tools and the latest trends in app/web design. I'm also interested in sustainability and climate change, having one hobby project dedicated to hopefully tackle that. Other hobbies include music ([my main playlist](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/3UwTfkqZMLQ2Z4jJbpHwu2?si=e2b35ca587694a38)), concerts, sci-fi, gaming and reading ([goodreads](https://goodreads.com/capperstrnd)).

- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for work, have over 4 years of professional experience in backend/frontend (primarily C#/React/Typescript)!
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on saving the climate
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Ionic Framework, iOS Swift and Android Kotlin

If you're interested in my resume for work, or collaborating on a project and/or discussing the latest tech trends, feel free to connect on ðŸ“« !['robots beware - electrified postage method, ask a friend if you can't see this <3'](./assets/reachme.png) or [@capperstrnd on Discord](https://discord.com/users/capperstrnd)!

> Note: This Github is otherwise pretty sparse since I maintain my projects on a self-hosted [Gogs](https://github.com/gogs/gogs) instance on my home server.
