# Hello there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a calm, curious and somewhat eccentric personality with a passion for programming and a keen sense and eye for code architecture, UX and design.

In my free time you can find me working on my [vanlife build](https://instagram.com/wheeldwell) (soon to be my permanent residence âœ¨) or various programming projects, researching new frameworks and tools and the latest trends in app/web design. I'm also interested in sustainability and climate change, having one hobby project dedicated to hopefully tackle that. Other hobbies include music ([my playlist](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/3UwTfkqZMLQ2Z4jJbpHwu2?si=e2b35ca587694a38)), concerts, sci-fi, gaming and reading ([goodreads](https://goodreads.com/capperstrnd)).

- ðŸ¤” **Iâ€™m looking for work opportunities**, with over 4 years of professional experience as a fullstacker (primarily CMS/e-com/PIM with C#/React/Typescript/InRiver)!
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on climate/sustainability projects
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Ionic Framework, iOS Swift and Android Kotlin

If you're interested in my resume, or collaborating on a project and/or discussing the latest tech trends, feel free to connect on:
